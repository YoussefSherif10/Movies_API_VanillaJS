# Problem Statement - Movie Application
Extensive metadata for movies can help fans around the globe explore the world of movies and entertainment. Users can read reviews, decide on what movies to watch based on user ratings and reviews. To expose the users to data, APIs are created. These APIs are the building blocks of modern applications, that allow applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be created using a framework or pure JavaScript called as VanillaJS.​ ​

Build a REST API using vanilla JS to manage the movie details. The Node application must read the data from a .json file as a REST resource and be able to add a new movie, fetch all the movies, fetch a specific movie by id, delete a movie and update the details of a specific movie.​

The REST resource must be hosted on the ​local machine on a specific port,​ use the package json-server ​to perform the same.

## Tasks

1. Create a HTTP server to service requests from clients​
2. Create a db.json file to hold the REST resource data ​
3. Run the db.json file as a server on a specified port​
4. Define all http methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE​
5. Define routes to​
    - Get all the movies​
    - Get a movie by movieId​
    - Create a new movie and post the data​
    - Update the details of a specific movie​
    - Delete a movie by movieId​
6. Test the output in the REST Client Postman​
